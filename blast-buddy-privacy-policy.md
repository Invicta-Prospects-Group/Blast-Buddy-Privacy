This Privacy Policy explains how **INVICTA PROSPECTS GROUP PTY LTD** (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use the **Blast Buddy** mobile app and related services (“App”). By using the App, you agree to this Policy.

## 1. What we collect

### 1.1 Account & identity
- Email address, name, and a user ID from our sign-in system.
- Authentication tokens (access/refresh) stored securely on your device to keep you signed in.

### 1.2 App data you provide
- User profiles you create in the App.
- Exposure records you enter (e.g., dates/times and exposure details you choose to provide).

### 1.3 Device & diagnostics (minimal)
- Basic device and app information (e.g., OS version, device model) for functionality and troubleshooting.
- Crash/diagnostic logs if the App encounters an error.

## 2. How we use information

- Authenticate requests, maintain security, and prevent abuse.
- Offer support and respond to inquiries.

We do not sell your personal data. The App does not include third-party advertising.

## 3. Storage & transfers
- **On your device:** A local database (SQLite) stores your profiles and exposures. Authentication tokens are stored in platform Secure Storage.
- **In our cloud (when you sign in and sync):** Account and exposure data are stored with Microsoft Azure services (e.g., Azure SQL Database). Data may be processed in regions where Azure operates to maintain the service.
- **Retention:** We retain cloud data while your account is active. You may request deletion at any time (see Section 7).

---

## 4. Sharing
We share data only with service providers that help operate the App (e.g., hosting and authentication). They act on our behalf under contracts and may not use your data for their own purposes. We may disclose information if required by law, regulation, or legal process, or to protect rights, safety, and security.

---

## 5. Security
- Encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS).
- Platform Secure Storage for tokens on device.
- Access controls and least-privilege practices in our cloud.

_No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. Please keep your device and credentials safe._

## 6. Your choices
- Use the App offline; data remains on your device until you sign in and choose to sync.
- Edit your profiles and exposures within the App.
- Export cloud-stored data or request deletion at any time by contacting us.
- Sign out to stop cloud sync. Uninstall the App or use in-app controls to remove local data.

## 7. Account & data deletion
To delete your cloud-stored data, email **louis@invictaprospectsgroup.com** from your account email with the subject “Delete my Blast Buddy data.” After verifying ownership, we will delete your account and associated cloud data unless retention is required by law. Local data on your device can be removed by clearing data in the App or uninstalling it.

## 8. Children’s privacy
The App is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age in your country), and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

## 9. International users
Your information may be processed in countries other than your own. Where required, we implement appropriate safeguards for international transfers.
